<li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, mix the oil, maple syrup, vanilla, cinnamon, allspice, and salt.</li>
<li>Add the rolled oats, puffed rice, and pecans. Stir with wooden spoon to evenly coat.</li>
<li>Spread onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and bake around 25 to 30 minutes until golden and toasted, stirring once.</li> 
<li>Remove from oven and allow to cool completely: the granola becomes crispy as it cools. Store in airtight container.</li>
