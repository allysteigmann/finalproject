<li>Dice the bell pepper. Whisk the eggs in small bowl and add the salt and pepper. Drain and rinse the black beans.</li>
<li>Add 1 tablespoon butter to a skillet and heat on medium until melted. Add the eggs to the pan and cook for about 1 minute. When the eggs just start to set, use a flat spatula to slowly scrape sections of eggs, creating folds. Sprinkle on the black beans, bell pepper, and kosher salt. Keep cooking, scraping occasionally until eggs are fully cooked, about 2 minutes. Remove to bowl and set aside.</li>
<li>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to the skillet and heat over medium high heat. Add a tortilla, half the shredded cheese, the scrambled eggs, remaining cheese, and the other tortilla. Cook 1 to 2 minutes per side, until browned and crispy. Cut into wedges and serve with guacamole and salsa for dipping.</li>
